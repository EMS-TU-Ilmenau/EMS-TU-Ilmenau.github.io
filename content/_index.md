The Group of Electronic Measurement and Signal Processing (EMS) at the [Institute for Information Technology](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/ei-init) of Technische Universität Ilmenau forms a joint research group with the group of the same name at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html) (IIS).

Under the acting leadership of Jun.-Prof. Dr.-Ing. Thomas Dallmann, around 40 researchers are currently working in the field of mobile communications and signal processing. 
The group conducts basic research with the aim of transferring research results into application-oriented projects. It is funded by public institutions as well as by contracts from industry.

The group closely cooperates with the [Group of Radio Technologies for Automated and Connected Vehicles](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/university/departments/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-information-technology/profile/institutes-and-groups/fachgebiet-funktechnologien-fuer-automatisierte-und-vernetzte-fahrzeuge) (FAVF) and the [Group of Signal Processing for Intelligent Sensor Systems](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/university/departments/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-information-technology/profile/institutes-and-groups/signal-processing-for-intelligent-sensor-systems) (SIS).
