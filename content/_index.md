The Electronic Measurement and Signal Processing EMS Research Group at the Institute for Information Technology at the Technical University of Ilmenau forms a joint research group with the same-named department within the Communication Systems Division at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS.

A group of 60 researchers led by Prof. Giovanni Del Galdo works in the field of mobile communications and signal processing. With this, the group carries out fundamental research with the aim of transferring its results into application-oriented projects funded by public institutions and industrial partners.

In a joint research activity with the Dependable Machine-to-Machine Communication Research Group, we conduct research on robust transmission processes for dependable communication.
